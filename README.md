# Filesystem Viewer

by J. Blackburn

Last Updated: Jan 13 2025 (**WIP**)

Shows content of text files within a directory. Uses node to serve content via a local web server.
Intended for quick and easy access to text files anywhere in the local filesystem. 
Example use case: viewing code from a distant project without mucking up one's text editor with files used only for reference.
